   - Determine user impact
   - Check system metrics

2. **Implement Workarounds**
   - Apply known fixes
   - Enable fallback systems
   - Implement temporary solutions

### Resolution (30 minutes - 2 hours)
1. **Debug and Fix**
   - Investigate root cause
   - Implement permanent fix
   - Test thoroughly
   - Deploy to production

2. **Monitor and Verify**
   - Watch system metrics
   - Confirm user functionality
   - Update stakeholders

## Common Incident Scenarios

### Database Connectivity Issues

**Symptoms:**

3. Check connection pool settings
4. Review recent database changes

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Restart database service if needed
2. Scale database resources if overloaded
3. Check for long-running queries
4. Verify connection pool configuration

### API Rate Limiting

**Symptoms:**
- 429 errors returned to clients
- High API usage metrics
- Customer complaints about throttling

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check current rate limit settings
2. Review API usage patterns
3. Identify high-volume clients
4. Check for potential abuse

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Adjust rate limits if appropriate
2. Implement better rate limiting logic
3. Contact high-volume clients
4. Add monitoring for rate limit events

### Worker Service Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Keyword expansion not working
- SERP analysis failing
- Clustering jobs stuck

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check worker service status
2. Review worker logs
3. Check queue depths
4. Verify external API access

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Restart failed workers
2. Scale worker instances if needed
3. Check external API quotas
4. Implement retry logic improvements

### Frontend Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Users unable to access application
- UI components not loading
