# TODO.md

## PHASE 1: Monorepo Scaffold and Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Monorepo structure: `apps/frontend`, `apps/gateway`, `apps/workers`, `packages/shared`.
- [x] Root `package.json` workspaces, `tsconfig.json` paths, ESLint, Prettier.
- [x] GitHub Actions CI/CD: lint/typecheck/test, Docker build/scan with Trivy.
- [x] `docker-compose.yml`: Postgres, OpenSearch, ClickHouse, Redis, NATS, MinIO, Prometheus, Grafana.
- [x] `.env` template with all service configs.
- [x] `scripts/init-db.sql`: Postgres schema with `pgvector`, RLS, sample data.
- [x] Frontend: Next.js 14, Ant Design, Tailwind CSS, Recharts/AntV, TanStack Query.
- [x] Gateway: NestJS, TypeORM, JWT auth, OpenAPI 3.1, Zod validation.
- [x] Workers: FastAPI, requirements.txt, Dockerfile.
- [x] Shared: TypeScript types, Zod schemas, utilities.

## PHASE 2: API Endpoints & Worker Services
- [x] TypeORM entities: `Org`, `User`, `Project`, `Seed`, `Keyword`, `Cluster`, `SerpResult`, `Brief`, `Export`, `AuditLog`.
- [x] Gateway API: `/v1/projects`, `/v1/seeds`, `/v1/auth` with JWT guards.
- [x] Workers: `expand-worker` (BM25, KeyBERT, YAKE), `serp-worker` (SERP API), `intent-worker` (classifier).
- [x] Event bus integration with NATS.
- [x] Database migrations and seeding.

## PHASE 3: Frontend (Next.js + Ant Design)
- [x] Dashboard: KPIs, charts, recent activity.
- [x] Projects: CRUD, status tracking, seed management.
- [x] Keywords: table with filters, SERP details drawer, clustering view.
- [x] Layout: navigation, responsive design, theme integration.
- [x] API integration with TanStack Query.
- [x] Error handling and loading states.

## PHASE 4: Monitoring & Observability
- [x] Prometheus metrics for Python workers.
- [x] Grafana dashboard with key metrics.
- [x] Structured logging with `structlog`.
- [x] Health checks for all services.
- [x] Security: robots.txt compliance, rate limiting, URL sanitization.

## PHASE 5: Testing & Launch Readiness
- [x] Unit: dedupe logic; intent classifier; difficulty calc; cluster labeling; SERP feature parser.
- [x] Integration: seed → expand → SERP enrich → cluster → score → brief → export.
- [x] Regression: seasonality/trend forecasts vs held-out months (if enabled).
- [x] E2E (Playwright): create project → add seeds → expand → cluster → draft brief → export CSV & push to Notion.
- [x] Load: 100k keyword expansion; SERP concurrency & backoff; OpenSearch shard pressure.
- [x] Chaos: provider quota breach; slow cluster jobs; export retries; ensure graceful degradation.
- [x] SLO verification (expand/serp/cluster/brief).
- [x] Demo tenant + sample projects; runbooks & on-call.
- [x] Pricing/quotas (seeds/day, SERP calls, exports); usage metering & alerts.

## PHASE 6: Advanced Features & Optimization
- [x] Content brief generation with AI templates.
- [x] Export formats: CSV, Excel, Notion, Google Sheets.
- [x] Advanced clustering: hierarchical, topic modeling.
- [x] SERP feature analysis: featured snippets, PAA, local packs.
- [x] Keyword difficulty scoring with ML models.
- [x] Trend analysis and seasonality detection.
- [x] Competitor analysis and gap detection.
- [x] Performance optimization: caching, indexing, query optimization.

## PHASE 7: Enterprise Features
- [x] Multi-tenant architecture with data isolation.
- [x] Role-based access control (RBAC).
- [x] Audit logging and compliance.
- [x] API rate limiting and quotas.
- [x] Custom integrations and webhooks.
- [x] Advanced analytics and reporting.
- [x] White-label solutions.
- [x] Enterprise SSO and SAML.

## PHASE 8: Production Deployment
- [x] Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts.
- [x] Production monitoring and alerting.
- [x] Backup and disaster recovery.
- [x] Security hardening and penetration testing.
- [x] Performance testing and optimization.
- [x] Documentation and training materials.
- [x] Go-live checklist and procedures.

**Phase 8 Summary**: Production deployment infrastructure completed with comprehensive Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, monitoring/alerting setup, backup/disaster recovery procedures, security hardening, performance testing framework, and complete documentation with go-live checklist. The SEO tool is now production-ready with enterprise-grade deployment, monitoring, security, and operational procedures.
